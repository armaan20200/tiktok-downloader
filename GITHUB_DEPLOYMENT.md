# GitHub Deployment Guide

## Step 1: Prepare Your Repository

### 1.1 Create a GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Name it: `tiktok-downloader` (or your preferred name)
5. Make it public or private
6. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
7. Click "Create repository"

### 1.2 Get Your Repository URL
After creating, you'll see a page with commands. Copy the HTTPS URL, it looks like:
```
https://github.com/yourusername/tiktok-downloader.git
```

## Step 2: Upload Your Code

### Option A: Using Git Commands (Recommended)

1. **Initialize Git in your project:**
```bash
git init
```

2. **Add all files:**
```bash
git add .
```

3. **Make your first commit:**
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: TikTok video downloader with mobile support"
```

4. **Connect to GitHub:**
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/tiktok-downloader.git
```

5. **Push to GitHub:**
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

### Option B: Using GitHub Web Interface

1. Download all your project files to your computer
2. Go to your empty GitHub repository
3. Click "uploading an existing file"
4. Drag and drop all your project files
5. Write a commit message: "Initial commit: TikTok video downloader"
6. Click "Commit changes"

## Step 3: Deploy to Cloud Platforms

### Deploy to Render (Recommended - Free Tier Available)

1. Go to [Render.com](https://render.com) and sign up
2. Connect your GitHub account
3. Click "New +" â†’ "Web Service"
4. Connect your repository
5. Use these settings:
   - **Name**: `tiktok-downloader`
   - **Environment**: `Python 3`
   - **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements-deploy.txt`
   - **Start Command**: `gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT main:app`
   - **Instance Type**: `Free` (or higher for better performance)

6. Click "Create Web Service"
7. Wait for deployment (5-10 minutes)
8. Your app will be available at: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com`

### Deploy to Railway (Easy Alternative)

1. Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click "New Project" â†’ "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your repository
5. Railway automatically detects Python and deploys
6. Your app will be available at the provided URL

### Deploy to Heroku (Paid Platform)

1. Install [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)
2. Login: `heroku login`
3. Create app: `heroku create your-app-name`
4. Push: `git push heroku main`
5. Open: `heroku open`

## Step 4: Update README with Your Repository URL

After uploading to GitHub, update the README.md file:

1. Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username
2. Update the clone URL in the installation section
3. Add your live demo URL once deployed

## Files Created for GitHub

âœ… **README.md** - Complete project documentation
âœ… **LICENSE** - MIT License for open source
âœ… **.gitignore** - Excludes temporary and system files
âœ… **requirements-deploy.txt** - Dependencies for deployment
âœ… **GITHUB_DEPLOYMENT.md** - This deployment guide

## Important Notes

- **Requirements File**: Use `requirements-deploy.txt` for deployment platforms
- **Environment Variables**: No special configuration needed - the app works out of the box
- **Domain**: After deployment, you'll get a free domain like `your-app.onrender.com`
- **Mobile Optimization**: Your app is already optimized for mobile devices

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Build Failed**: Check that `requirements-deploy.txt` is in the root directory
2. **App Won't Start**: Ensure the start command is exactly: `gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT main:app`
3. **Downloads Not Working**: This is normal on some free hosting - videos will still download to user's device

### Getting Help:

1. Check deployment platform logs (Render/Railway dashboard)
2. Create an issue in your GitHub repository
3. Ensure all files are uploaded correctly

## Success! ðŸŽ‰

Once deployed, your TikTok downloader will be available worldwide with:
- Mobile-optimized interface
- Support for all TikTok URL formats
- Watermark-free downloads
